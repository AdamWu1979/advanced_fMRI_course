There are tons of resources neuroimaging data analysis on-line so the following list is not meant to be exhaustive. There are also similar lists here and there that might partly overlap with this one.

* [Jonathan Peelle]() has a great [list of ressources ](http://jonathanpeelle.net/mri-resources-for-beginners) for beginners
* [https://github.com/brainhack101](https://github.com/brainhack101)  also has a good [collections or links](https://brainhack101.github.io/neurolinks/) to courses, data...
* ReproNim has a good [site](http://www.reproducibleimaging.org/index.html) to check for ressources on how to get up to date on doing reproducible research


## Online courses

There are quite a few courses out there that I am aware of. Also most of the main analysis softwares have at least one video series of course +/- turorial.

### Coursera

[Tor Wager]() and Martin Lindquist offer a 2 parts MOOC on coursera.

* [part 1](https://en.coursera.org/learn/functional-mri)
* [part 2](https://en.coursera.org/learn/functional-mri-2)

### SPM

### Freesurfer

### FSL

### AFNI

### Neurohackademy
Neurohackademy is not exactly a beginner's course for fMRI: it is more focused

## Video series

### mumfordbrainstats

Jeanette Mumford has a fantastic series of videos on neuroimaging analysis on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ7gF0zm35FwrFpDND6DWeA). The channel also has [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mumfordbrainstats/) (as well as a [tumblr](http://mumfordbrainstats.tumblr.com/) and [twitter account](https://twitter.com/mumbrainstats) ) if you have questions.

### Andrew Jahn
[Here] for the video(https://www.youtube.com/user/Shala5ha5ka) but he also as a [blog](https://www.andysbrainblog.com/) (see the old version [here](http://andysbrainblog.blogspot.com)).

### Center for Brains, Minds and Machines
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGoxKRfTs0jQP52cfHCyyRQ)

### Organization from human brain mapping
The videos of the lectures and workshops from the previous HBM conferences are available online [here](https://www.pathlms.com/ohbm/courses).

### fMRIf summer school series from the NIH

## Blogs

There are quite a few descent blogs run by neuroscientists where you can find interesting and more or less technical information on neuroimaging analysis.

##    Methods and results reporting

An interesting paper that shows how little information is sometimes provided by authors : The secret lives of experiments: Methods reporting in the fMRI literature (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811912007057.

        This site (http://www.fmrimethods.org/index.php/Main_Page)Links to an external site. lists a set of minimally acceptable standards for the reporting of research studies using fMRI. The associated recommended readings (http://www.fmrimethods.org/index.php/Recommended_Reading)Links to an external site. should not be overlooked.
        This blog post has also some additional (http://practicalfmri.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/methods-reporting-in-fmri-literature.html. interesting (http://practicalfmri.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/draft-checklist-for-fmri-methods.html. suggestions.
        A short article on to make better figures (with links to some matlab code): Data Visualization in the Neurosciences: Overcoming the Curse of Dimensionality (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662731200428X.
